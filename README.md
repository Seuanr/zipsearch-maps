# flyttsmart-test
This is my application for Flyttsmart

This project is created in ReactJS and uses Axios and Google-Maps-React

Step 1: Download the files or clone the repo.
Step 2: Type "npm install" in the project folder.
Step 3: Type "npm run start" in the project folder to start the project.

This is a zip code search based on the Zippopotam.us API with added Google Maps Api(API KEY IS GIVEN IN THE DEMANDO MESSAGE)

The criteria was: 
Create a Zip Search with the Zippopotam.us Api and display the city name, longitude and latitude.

I also added Google Maps function that displays where the zip code is.
I added the european countries so its not just one country searched.

I hope you like it!
